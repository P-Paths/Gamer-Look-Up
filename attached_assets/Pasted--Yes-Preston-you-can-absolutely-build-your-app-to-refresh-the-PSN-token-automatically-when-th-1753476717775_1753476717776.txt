🔥 **Yes, Preston — you can absolutely build your app to refresh the PSN token automatically when the user logs in.** But here’s the truth:

⚠️ **The NPSSO token is not truly refreshable like an OAuth token** — Sony doesn’t give developers a real “refresh token” flow like Google or Facebook. So we have two options:

---

## 🧠 **REALITY CHECK: How NPSSO Tokens Work**

* ✅ **NPSSO** is a long-lived token (\~30–60 days)
* ❌ It **cannot be programmatically refreshed**
* ✅ Users can manually re-authenticate to generate a new token
* 🔐 To fully automate login/token refresh, you’d need to simulate login flow (which requires **Puppeteer** or browser emulation)

---

## 💡 **Two Real Options to Handle It**

### 🔁 Option 1: **Semi-Automated Login Token Refresh Flow**

> ✅ Most realistic and legal for production

1. **User logs in through your app**
2. You direct them to Sony’s login page:
   `https://auth.api.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/2.0/oauth/authorize?...`
3. After login, they paste back their **NPSSO token** (or you parse it from cookies)
4. You **save it to their profile** in your app
5. Every API call uses that NPSSO until it expires

> 🔐 Best if you add **email reminders** like:
> *“Your PSN connection will expire soon. Click here to reconnect.”*

---

### 🧙 Option 2: **Full Login Automation with Puppeteer**

> ⚠️ Advanced, less compliant with Sony’s TOS, but fully automated for internal use/demos

* Use [**Puppeteer**](https://pptr.dev/) or [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to:

  * Open headless browser
  * Log in with the user’s credentials
  * Intercept cookies to extract NPSSO token
* Refresh the token behind the scenes when expired

> 🔒 This requires storing PSN username & password securely
> Not safe for public product use, but works for demos, agents, or internal tools

## ✅ Recommended Flow for You (NOW)

Since you’re running demos and pitching clients:

### ✔️ Setup a background service like this:

```ts
// When user logs in:
if (user.psnTokenExpired) {
  redirectTo('https://ca.account.sony.com/api/v1/ssocookie');
  // Ask user to paste NPSSO token again
}
```

Then store the new token in your DB and continue fetching.

---

## 🧰 Bonus Tip:

Set a cron job or background task to **ping Sony’s API every few days**. If it returns token expired, mark user profile as needing reconnection.

## 🛠️ Want Help?

I can:

* ✅ Build the **“Reconnect your PSN” popup**
* ✅ Add logic to check token expiry
* ✅ Automate the Puppeteer login flow for internal use

### 🎯 Your Move:

Wanna:

1. Add a **manual refresh screen** for NPSSO?
2. Automate login using Puppeteer?
3. Get a full “Reconnect PSN” flow built today?
