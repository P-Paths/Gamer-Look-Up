2. **Upload files in batches**:
   - Click "uploading an existing file" or "Add file" → "Upload files"
   - Drag and drop these files first:
     - `README.md`
     - `DEPLOYMENT.md` 
     - `package.json`
     - `.gitignore`

3. **Upload folders**:
   - Create new folders by typing `client/` then upload client files

4. **Add commit message**:
   ```
