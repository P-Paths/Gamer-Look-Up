## Current Situation
- You paid $5 for Xbox API access
- Getting authentic profile data (gamerscore: 2860, avatar)
- But no games/hours data showing

## OpenXBL Pricing Structure (2025)

2. **Small Plan**: Monthly subscription (exact price not public)
3. **Medium Plan**: Monthly subscription (exact price not public)  
4. **Large Plan**: Monthly subscription (exact price not public)

### **What Your $5 Likely Covers:**

- May not include full games history endpoints

## Available Xbox Data Endpoints:

### **Profile Data** (What you're getting):
- ✅ Basic profile info
- ✅ Gamerscore (2860)
- ✅ Avatar image
- ✅ Account details

### **Games Data** (What you need):
- `/api/v2/player/titleHistory/{xuid}` - Game history
- `/api/v2/player/summary/{xuid}` - Player summary with games
- `/api/v2/achievements/player/{xuid}` - Achievements per game

## Testing Your Access Level

I'm now testing multiple endpoints to see what your $5 subscription actually unlocks:

1. **Title History**: Game library with playtime
2. **Player Summary**: Detailed stats
3. **Achievements**: Per-game achievement data
4. **Recent Players**: Activity tracking

## Next Steps:

1. **Test all available endpoints** with your current subscription
2. **Identify which specific plan you have**
3. **Determine if upgrade needed** for full games data
4. **Compare with alternative Xbox APIs** if needed

## Alternative Xbox Data Sources:
- **XboxAPI.com**: Different API service
- **Microsoft Xbox Services API**: Official but requires game developer account
- **TrueAchievements**: Web scraping (limited)

Your $5 payment should unlock more than just profile data. Let me test all possible endpoints to see what you actually have access to.
